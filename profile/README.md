## Welcome to Floss ðŸ‘‹

Floss is the home of various open source libs put together at Dentech to make Golang development on CloudRun a breeze. These libs provide the common and reusable boilerplate code for the microservices we build and run on CloudRun, utilizing mature and stable tech/libs such as gRPC, Watermill, Zap, GORM and OpenTelemetry to integrate with GCP infrastructure such as Cloud SQL, Cloud Logging and Pub/Sub. Hope you find anything useful :)
